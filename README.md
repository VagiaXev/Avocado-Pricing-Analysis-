# Avocado-Pricing-Analysis-
Analyzing the avocado prices for 5 states in the USA. 

The raw data was in CSV format and came from Kaggle dataset. 

For the current analysis, MySQL Workbench, Python and Power BI were used.

The steps that we applied to the dataset arisen from Kaggle Dataset were the following ones:

1. Remove irrelevant data by using MySQL Workbench.
2. Data cleaning using Pandas and Numpy libraries in Python (convert data types, take care of missing values, rename columns).
3. Data transformation using Pandas and Numpy libraries in Python (calculate of new fiels for better data understanding).
4. Data Visualization using Matplotlib libary in Python for outliers detection
5. Data Visualization using Power BI to prepare a dashboard with all the useful information.
